This folder contains the [graphql.ts](graphql.ts) file. It initializes the [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/)
to work with the [GraphQL Resolvers](../../graphql/resolvers) and also creates the [Context](graphql/Context.ts)
object to be used on the whole back-end application.

All resources related to the GraphQL implementation are on [graphql folder](../../graphql)
