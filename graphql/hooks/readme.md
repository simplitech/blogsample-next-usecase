# GraphQL's Hooks

This folder contains all GraphQL queries that will be transformed into [Urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/)
hooks by [Graphql-Code-Generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/).

The best way to create the queries is to build them using the 
[project's GraphQL Playground](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql). Open the "Schema" tab to copy the type names for the
query arguments.
