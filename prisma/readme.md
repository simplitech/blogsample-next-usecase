# Prisma

Here we have all files related to database, which are handled by [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)

The queries are being executed by [process](../graphql/process) and the [CRUD](../graphql/crud) resolvers.

Execute `yarn prisma` everytime you change `schema.prisma` file.

Execute `yarn studio` to visualize and edit the database data.
